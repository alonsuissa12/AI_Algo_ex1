     * Here is a nice documentation written by:  Orya Shlomo:
     * <p>
     * a) We asked to write a code while given a natural even number greater than 4, n, find two prime numbers that the sum of both of them equal to n.
     * First of all, we should invent a function that know says which number is prime and which number is not a prime. This function will have to include all the options. (The explanation about this function is above its code).
     * stage 1: We will open a "for" loop, define p1 as an integer variable. The "for" loop will run over its block below from p1=3 ,while p1 < n/2. After everytime "for" do its block, the value of p1 gets more 2.
     * This "for" loop go over all the odd numbers, because all the even numbers aren't prime. (2 divide all the even numbers without a remainder).
     * Inside "for" we will define a new integer variable, p2, that equal to (n - p1), because want to find two numbers that the sum of both of them equal to n.
     * After this we will open an "if" and use the CheckPrime function to Check if p1 and p2 are prime numbers. If p1 and p2 are prime numbers, print "n = p1 + p2", do "break" and go out from the "for" loop.
     * <p>
     * b) First of all, we define a new integer variable called "p4". We will open a "for" loop that began from p4=2, run while p4 > 0 and after everytime it go over its block, p4 gets 1 into its value.
     * Inside "for" we will define a new integer variable, called p3, such that p4-p3=n. Now, we want to check if p4 and p3 are prime, so we do it with using "if" and "CheckPrime".
     * If p4 and p3 are prime, we will say the program to print "n=p4-p3" and "break", exit from the loop (for). But if does not exist that p4 and p3 are prime, the computer will continue running in "for".
     * <p>
     * c) First, we will define a new integer variable, called counter1, with a first value 0. (Counter1 will count for us all the prime number are between [2,n).
     * Second, we define a for loop and an integer variable i. "for" run from i=2, while i>n  and adding 1 to i after anytime it does the bloch below.
     * Now, we will use "if", because we want to know if i is prime. If i is prime, counter1=counter1+1. (everytime the computer will find
     * a prime number, the counter will rise by one.
     * <p>
     * d) We want to find the composition to any ,"n", natural even number I get.
     * First, if n is prime, we don't need to look for any number, because the decomposition of a prime number is the number itself.
     * so, if I get number=2, I will print "2". If I don't get a prime number, I need to find two prime numbers such that
     * the multiple of these two numbers is "n" and both of them are prime. If I found two numbers that fit, I print the multiple of them. But
     * if I found only two number such that one of them doesn't prime, i will do enter into "n" the value of this number
     * and do the algorithm above until "n" become to a prime number and everytime I find a prime number that divide "n" without a remainder, I print this number.
     * <p>
     * e) We will use "System.nanoTime()" in order to measure the time. I save the time before the program begin and do the sam at the end of the program. After the program finished running,
     * I compute the difference between them and print. (The measure at the start and at the end, will be with "long",
     * because I want the measure to be more precise.

     * Here is a nice pseudo-code solution written by:Yotam Shahak
     * Pseudo-code:
     * A. find if number is prime or not
     * 1. input (n)                           // assuming n is a natural number n>0
     * 2. if (n<2) return false               // if n<2 n is Not Prime
     * 3. if (n=2||3) return true             // if n=2 or n=3 n is Prime
     * 4. if (n%2=0 || n%3=0) return false    // if it is zero, n is Not Prime(divide by 2 or 3)
     * 5. for (i=5, i*i<=n, i+6){             // loop over all numbers 5<=i<=n^0.5 increment i by 6
     * 6. if (n%i=0 || n%(i+2)=0 return false // if it is zero, n is Not Prime
     * 7. }                                   // the end of for loop
     * 8. return true                         // n is Prime
     * <p>
     * B. find two Prime numbers p1+p2=N
     * 1. int p1=2
     * 2. while p1< N-1                       // loop over all number (2,N-1)
     * 3. if p1 (isPrime){                    // check if p1 is Prime number or not
     * 4. int p2=N-p1                         // the value of p2
     * 5. if p2 is Prime                      // check if p2 is Prime number or not
     * 6. print (N=p1+p2)}                    // print the answer
     * 7. Break                               // end of while loop
     * 8. p1++                                // increment p1 by 1
     * <p>
     * C. find two Prime numbers p4-p3=N
     * 1. int p3=2
     * 2. while p3< Max value of Int0         // loop over all number (2, Max value of Int)
     * 3. if p1 (isPrime){                    // check if p1 is Prime number or not
     * 4. int p4= N+p3                        // the value of p3
     * 5. if p4 is Prime                      // check if p4 is Prime number or not
     * 6. print (N=p4-P3)}                    // print the answer
     * 7. Break                               // end of while loop
     * 8. p3++                                // increment p1 by 1
     * <p>
     * D. find how many Prime numbers (2,N)

     * 3. while (p5<N-1) {                    // loop over all number (2,N-1)
     * 4. if p5 isPrime                       // check if p5 is Prime or not
     * 5. Y++ & p5++                          // increment y by 1 and p5 by 1
     * 6. else p5++                           // increment p5 by 1
     * 7. }                                   // end of while loop
